# What is qbot?

qbot is an open sourced Discord bot used for ROBLOX management, it is a bot packed with many features with more coming. This is unique as you are able to host the bot by using our handy instructions and our Support Team with no fee, they are located in our Discord server. By using qbot, you're also able to try learn how the bot works yourself, meaning you can learn how Nodejs works and even add your own commands!

**Before you can use this repository to install any addons/plugins, you need to take a look at the [qbot repository.](https://github.com/yogurtsyum/qbot) You'll need to follow the instructions there to be able to use some of these plugins, I did not create qbot.**

# How can I add a plugin/addon to qbot?

Each folder will have a plugin with a set of instructions. You'll usually see a ``instructions-for-install.md`` file and the command file which will look like ``rank.js``. If you find a plugin hard to install, you could simply join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Q7m7gnW) and speak to me or someone else.

# Disclaimers/Notes

This is not official and it's just what I use to put all my plugins in for others to use, this means you may not recieve support on the plugins as the Support Team isn't trained for this.

NO PLUGINS WILL BE ADDED UNTIL THE COMMAND HANDLER FOR QBOT COMES OUT, THIS MAY BE IN VERSION 5.1!
